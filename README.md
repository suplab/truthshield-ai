# ✅ Deep Fake Detection & Ethics Advisor

**Objective:** Autonomous agent that detects AI-generated content, flags potential misinformation, and produces explainable reports.

## MVP Features:

- Upload image, video, or text content.
- Detect if content is AI-generated.
- Assess potential impact (e.g., political, social, financial).
- Generate a human-readable report with risk scoring.

## Agentic Workflow:

1. User uploads media → Agent extracts features (frames, metadata, text).
2. Agent runs AI detection models (image/video: DeepFake detection; text: LLM content classification).
3.Agent cross-references content context (social media trends, news events) for risk scoring.
4. Agent generates a report with explanations and recommendations.
5. Optional: Agent flags suspicious content on social media using APIs.

## Tech Stack:

- Models: DeepFaceLab / FaceForensics++, HuggingFace transformers for text detection.
- LLM: GPT-4/GPT-4o-mini for report generation.
- Database: SQLite or vector DB for storing content fingerprints.
- Frontend: Streamlit or Gradio for rapid UI.
- Extras: Social media APIs for context enrichment.

## Hackathon Roadmap:

- Build upload interface → detect media type.
- Integrate pre-trained DeepFake detection model + text classifier.
- Generate a structured report using GPT API.
- Deploy on Streamlit/Gradio.
- Bonus: Connect to a social media feed for live scanning.
